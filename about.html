          Discover the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin. This is the
          largest and most impressive Orthodox church in Varna, and one of the
          symbols of the city. It was built in the late 19th century, in a
          neo-Byzantine style, with a domed roof and a bell tower. The interior
          is decorated with frescoes, icons, and stained glass windows. You can
          also climb up the tower and admire the panoramic view of the city.
